# Battle Logic

### This is the battle logic of the app 300Days. 

#### Back Logic

Each hero / enemy have their own Race (Human, Elf, Orc, Dwarf, etc), Class (Warrior, Archer, Spellcaster, Bard, Rogue), Attack Value, Defense Value and Current Health.



#### Before Normal Battle

The battle menu should split in half:

  - Left Half: Players hero show Attack Value, Defense Value, Current Health, Traits (3 Most), player swipes to change hero
  - Right Half: Enemy(s) show Attack Value, Defense Value, Current Health, Traits (3 Most)
  - Somewhere have a battle button and an escape button
